# My First MERN Project

I set my a challenge to stay up until I learn the basics of the MERN stack and finish a project. So this is the project.

I stayed up for 14+ hours to learn this stack and I was pleasantly surprised of how fun and easy it was to implement even when I was tired. I have learnt a lot about the stack and I also learnt about debugging in Nodejs and React.



## Installation

```js
cd client
npm install

cd server 
npm install
```

Look at the .env.example file to see what you need add

In the client directory run
```js
npm start
```

In the server directory run
```js
npm start
```

Enjoy :)
